  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Tau-PET is a prognostic marker for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and the heterogeneity of tau-PET patterns matches cognitive symptom heterogeneity. Thus, tau-PET may allow precision-medicine prediction of individual tau-related cognitive trajectories, which can be important for determining patient-specific cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures.                                         Methods                                We included Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal,                 n                 = 121) or Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively normal to dementia,                 n                 = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for independent validation (controls/Alzheimer's disease-spectrum=46/65). All participants underwent baseline                 18                 F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial                 R                 2                 ) between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to capture patient-specific cognitive decline.                                                        Results               In both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99{\textpm}7.69] and A05 [age = 74.03{\textpm}9.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort.                                         Conclusion               Combining tau-PET with task-fMRI-derived maps of major cognitive domains facilitates the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. This approach may help to increase the sensitivity to detect Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline and to determine personalized cognitive endpoints in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Converging paradigms in neurodegeneration             Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are progressive neurodegenerative diseases with increasing prevalence in our aging populations. Recent evidence suggests that some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathology of these diseases have similarities to those observed in infectious prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). Goedert reviews how the spread of a variety of pathological protein aggregates is involved in neurodegenerative disease.                            Science               , this issue p.               10.1126/science.1255555                        ,                             BACKGROUND                                Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common human neurodegenerative diseases. AD is primarily a dementing disease, and PD is a movement disorder. Together, they affect around 50 million people worldwide, with the vast majority of disease cases being sporadic. Their incidence increases with age. Like most neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD are caused by the aggregation of a small number of proteins, with filament assemblies constituting the end-point of protein aggregation. AD is characterized by the presence of abundant extracellular plaques made of amyloid assemblies of A{$\beta$} peptides and intraneuronal inclusions made of assembled tau protein. Some dominantly inherited cases of AD are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which gives rise to A{$\beta$}. In these cases, dysfunction of APP precedes dysfunction of tau. In contrast, mutations in                 MAPT                 , the tau gene, give rise to dominantly inherited frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism, with abundant tau inclusions in the absence of A{$\beta$} plaques. Extrapolation to the much more common sporadic cases of AD has given rise to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulates that A{$\beta$} aggregation causes the formation of tau inclusions, synaptic dysfunction, nerve cell death, and brain shrinkage. However, tau inclusions correlate better with cognitive impairment, and A{$\beta$} may exert its effects through tau. Strategies targeting the formation of A{$\beta$} and tau assemblies are valuable for the development of mechanism-based therapies. Unlike AD, in which two distinct amyloid assemblies are present, PD is characterized by intracellular deposits, Lewy bodies and neurites, both composed of the protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Dominantly inherited forms of PD are caused by mutations in                 SNCA                 , the {$\alpha$}-synuclein gene. More than 95\% of those diagnosed with PD have Lewy inclusions.                                                        ADVANCES               For many years, the mechanisms underlying AD and PD were widely believed to be cell-autonomous. This implies that the same molecular events, such as the formation of tau and {$\alpha$}-synuclein assemblies, occur independently in a large number of cells in an otherwise healthy brain. Recent findings have suggested instead that non--cell-autonomous processes play an important part in AD and PD. Inclusions are thought to form in a small number of cells and---given enough time and, perhaps, a genetic predisposition---spread in a deterministic manner to distant brain regions. The formation of the first A{$\beta$}, tau, and {$\alpha$}-synuclein inclusions is probably stochastic, with most seeds being degraded. Distinct molecular conformers of aggregated proteins (or strains) may underlie clinically different diseases. This is reminiscent of human prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, there is reluctance to use the term prion for the inclusions of AD and PD. The main reasons are that in contrast to Kuru and CJD, transmission of AD and PD has not been demonstrated between individuals, and most experimental studies have used transgenic animals that overexpress disease proteins.                                         OUTLOOK               The prion concept appears to apply to all human neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein assemblies, including AD and PD. This has brought unity to the field and changed the way we think about these diseases. It has been known for some time that a seed can template aggregation of the homologous protein. However, the ability of protein aggregates to spread through the nervous system had previously been underappreciated. At a practical level, the new findings are helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying disease, which may have therapeutic implications in all cases. It will be important to identify the molecular species of assembled host proteins responsible for propagation and neurotoxicity.                                                   A pathological pathway leading from soluble proteins to insoluble filaments.                                        This pathway is at the heart of human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The formation of pathological seeds is a rare and energetically unfavourable event, which requires exposure of backbone amide groups and a high protein concentration. Once a seed has formed, single molecules can change shape and join the growing aggregates. Seed addition induces rapid assembly of the soluble protein. Fragmentation generates new seeds, accelerating the formation of aggregates. Filaments represent the endpoints of aggregation. They are typically unbranched, with a diameter of {\textasciitilde}10 nm, and can be several micrometers long. This drawing is not to scale. [Adapted from S. K.

Extracellular deposits of A{$\beta$} and intraneuronal tau inclusions define Alzheimer's disease, whereas intracellular inclusions of {$\alpha$}-synuclein make up the Lewy pathology of Parkinson's disease. Most cases of disease are sporadic, but some are inherited in a dominant manner. Mutations frequently occur in the genes encoding A{$\beta$}, tau, and {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Overexpression of these mutant proteins can give rise to disease-associated phenotypes. Protein assembly begins in specific regions of the brain during the process of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, from where it spreads to other areas.},

  abstract = {Computational models of neurodegeneration aim to emulate the evolving pattern of pathology in the brain during neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have made specific choices on the mechanisms of pathology production and diffusion, or assume that all the subjects lie on the same disease progression trajectory. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of neurodegenerative pathology suggests that multiple mechanisms may contribute synergistically with complex interactions, meanwhile the degree of contribution of each mechanism may vary among individuals. We thus put forward a coupled-mechanisms modelling framework which non-linearly combines the network-topology-informed pathology appearance with the process of pathology spreading within a dynamic modelling system. We account for the heterogeneity of disease by fitting the model at the individual level, allowing the epicenters and rate of progression to vary among subjects. We construct a Bayesian model selection framework to account for feature importance and parameter uncertainty. This provides a combination of mechanisms that best explains the observations for each individual from the ADNI dataset. With the obtained distribution of mechanism importance for each subject, we are able to identify subgroups of patients sharing similar combinations of apparent mechanisms.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Model-based investigations of transneuronal spreading mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases relate the pattern of pathology severity to the brain's connectivity matrix, which reveals information about how pathology propagates through the connectivity network. Such network models typically use networks based on functional or structural connectivity in young and healthy individuals, and only end-stage patterns of pathology, thereby ignoring/excluding the effects of normal aging and disease progression. Here, we examine the sequence of changes in the elderly brain's anatomical connectivity over the course of a neurodegenerative disease. We do this in a data-driven manner that is not dependent upon clinical disease stage, by using event-based disease progression modeling. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, we sequence the progressive decline of anatomical connectivity, as quantified by graph-theory metrics, in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Ours is the first single model to contribute to understanding all three of the nature, the location, and the sequence of changes to anatomical connectivity in the human brain due to Alzheimer's disease. Our experimental results reveal new insights into Alzheimer's disease: that degeneration of anatomical connectivity in the brain may be a viable, even early, biomarker and should be considered when studying such neurodegenerative diseases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Patterns of dementia are known to fall into dissociated but dispersed brain networks, suggesting that the disease is transmitted along neuronal pathways rather than by proximity. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence for ``prion-like'' transsynaptic transmission of disease agents like misfolded tau and beta amyloid. We mathematically model this transmission by a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain's connectivity network obtained from tractography of 14 healthy-brain MRIs. Subsequent graph theoretic analysis provides a fully quantitative, testable, predictive model of dementia. Specifically, we predict spatially distinct ``persistent modes,'' which, we found, recapitulate known patterns of dementia and match recent reports of selectively vulnerable dissociated brain networks. Model predictions also closely match T1-weighted MRI volumetrics of 18 Alzheimer's and 18 frontotemporal dementia subjects. Prevalence rates predicted by the model strongly agree with published data. This work has many important implications, including dimensionality reduction, differential diagnosis, and especially prediction of future atrophy using baseline MRI morphometrics.},

Computational models that simulate the propagation of pathogens between connected brain regions have been used to elucidate mechanistic information about the spread of these disease biomarkers, such as disease epicentres and spreading rates. However, the connectomes that are used as substrates for these models are known to contain modality-specific false positive and false negative connections, influenced by the biases inherent to the different methods for estimating connections in the brain. In this work, we compare five types of connectomes for modelling both tau and atrophy patterns with the network diffusion model, which are validated against tau PET and structural MRI data from individuals with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia. We then test the hypothesis that a joint connectome, with combined information from different modalities, provides an improved substrate for the model. We find that a combination of multimodal information helps the model to capture observed patterns of tau deposition and atrophy better than any single modality. This is validated with data from independent datasets. Overall, our findings suggest that combining connectivity measures into a single connectome can mitigate some of the biases inherent to each modality and facilitate more accurate models of pathology spread, thus aiding our ability to understand disease mechanisms, and providing insight into the complementary information contained in different measures of brain connectivity},

Concomitant analytic advances enable rigorous identification and quantification of functionally important features of brain network architecture. Null models are a flexible tool to statistically benchmark the presence or magnitude of features of interest, by selectively preserving specific architectural properties of brain networks while systematically randomizing others. Here we describe the logic, implementation and interpretation of null models of connectomes. We introduce randomization and generative approaches to constructing null networks, and outline a taxonomy of network methods for statistical inference. We highlight the spectrum of null models --- from liberal models that control few network properties, to conservative models that recapitulate multiple properties of empirical networks ---that allow us to operationalize and test detailed hypotheses about the structure and function of brain networks. We review emerging scenarios for the application of null models in network neuroscience, including for spatially embedded networks, annotated networks and correlationderived networks. Finally, we consider the limits of null models, as well as outstanding questions for the field.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Tau is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and animal models have suggested that tau spreads from cell to cell through neuronal connections, facilitated by               {$\beta$}               -amyloid (A               {$\beta$}               ). We test this hypothesis in humans using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate tau spread, and compare these simulations to observed patterns measured using tau-PET in 312 individuals along Alzheimer's disease continuum. Up to 70\% of the variance in the overall spatial pattern of tau can be explained by our model. Surprisingly, the ESM predicts the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether brain A               {$\beta$}               is present, but regions with greater A               {$\beta$}               burden show greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of A               {$\beta$}               in accelerating tau spread. Altogether, our results provide evidence in humans that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain A               {$\beta$}               .},

  abstract = {The pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) damages structural and functional brain networks, resulting in cognitive impairment. The results of recent connectomics studies have now linked changes in structural and functional network organization in AD to the patterns of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau accumulation and spread, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the disease. In addition, the detection of gene-related connectome changes might aid in the early diagnosis of AD and facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies that are effective at earlier stages of the disease spectrum. In this article, we review studies of the associations between connectome changes and amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau pathologies as well as molecular genetics in different subtypes and stages of AD. We also highlight the utility of connectome-derived computational models for replicating empirical findings and for tracking and predicting the progression of biomarker-indicated AD pathophysiology.},
